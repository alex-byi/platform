title: 'Comments'
---

Comments in a programming language allow you to add textual explanations and notes directly into the code without affecting its execution. In **lsFusion**, comments are marked by two slashes `//`. Everything that follows these symbols until the end of the line is treated as a comment and is ignored by the interpreter.

### Examples

```lsf
// The version number should be increased when the API changes
apiVersion() = 23;

apiVersion() = 23; // The version number should be increased when the API changes
```
